#**Project 1: Basic Business or Personal Website**

*A full description of the project scope criteria can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/reference-page/projects).*

##Workflow Requirements

###User Stories:

**1.** "As a student studying web development I want a solution that will give me access to course materials from both web and mobile browsers so that I can study more efficiently."  *- Daniel*

**2.** "As a professional web developer I have to stay organized and be prepared. I want a centralized solution that will give me access to all of my cloud backups and documentation from both web and mobile browser." *- Laura*

**3.** "As a remote worker I need access to all of my online tools and conferencing apps from both web and mobile browser." *- Quincy*

###Wireframes:

**1.** First, I created a basic layout of the web and mobile interface design on Google sites.
*The Google Sites Reference Page can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/reference-page/projects).*

###Development Phase:

**2.**  GitHub Repository, *["Git_Repos"](https://mheerspink75.github.io/Pages/Mobile_Link_v1.html)*, recreates the basic design and functionality of the *[Google Sites Reference Pages](https://sites.google.com/view/reference-page/home)*.  *["Git_Repos"](https://mheerspink75.github.io/Pages/Mobile_Link_v1.html)* HTML5 and CSS3 is written with Microsoft Visual Studio Code. I focused here on the simplicity of the user interface design to accommodate mobile screens and serve as a centralized point for linking pages and launching apps. The mobile view of the version 1 design can be found hosted on  *[Google Sites Mobile Links Reference Page](https://sites.google.com/view/reference-page/mobile-links)*  The reengineered copy can be found here - *[Mobile Link v1](https://mheerspink75.github.io/Pages/Mobile_Link_v1.html)* Hosted on GitHub.

**3.** I then reworked the interface design to include more content pages, navigation menus, CSS grid and Google Custom Search optimized for web development search criteria. I have included a including user input form to add functionality to the [About Page](https://mheerspink75.github.io/Pages/About.html). The GitHub Repository *["mheerspink75.github.io"](https://github.com/mheerspink75/mheerspink75.github.io)* is now hosting the updated version [Mobile Link v2](https://mheerspink75.github.io/index.html).

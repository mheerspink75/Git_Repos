**Project:  Basic Business or Personal Website**

## Abstract:  
There is a lot of debate about what the future of web applications will look like.  More websites are presently implementing responsive web apps to accommodate mobile screens. The overwhelming majority of mobile users prefer using mobile apps over browser-based apps on mobile devices.  In the future, as more bandwidth and coverage become available to mobile devices, this may change with the network architecture. Mobile devices may take the form of thin clients that are reliant on server based applications. As web browsers become more advanced, PWAs or Progressive Web Apps are gaining more popularity. As a student tasked with creating a basic website, I created this site as a tool to supplement my studies and research these topics further.  As I continue to learn more coding languages I will continue updating and integrating this site.


## Workflow Requirements

### User Stories:

**1.** "As a student studying web development I want a solution that will give me access to course materials from both web and mobile browsers so that I can study more efficiently."  
*- Daniel*

**2.** "As a professional web developer I have to stay organized and be prepared. I want a centralized solution that will give me access to all of my cloud backups and documentation from both web and mobile browser."  
*- Laura*

**3.** "As a remote worker I need access to all of my online tools and conferencing apps from both web and mobile browser."  
*- Quincy*

### Wireframes:

**1.** First, I created a basic layout of the web and mobile interface design on Google sites.  
*The Google Sites Reference Page can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/reference-page/projects).*

### Development Phase:

**2.**  GitHub Repository, *["Git_Repos"](https://github.com/mheerspink75/Git_Repos)*, recreates the basic design and functionality of the *[Google Sites Reference Pages](https://sites.google.com/view/reference-page/home)*. HTML5 and CSS3 is written with Microsoft Visual Studio Code. I focused here on the simplicity of the user interface design to accommodate mobile screens and serve as a centralized point for linking pages and launching apps.  
The mobile view of the version 1 design can be found hosted on  *[Google Sites Mobile Links Reference Page](https://sites.google.com/view/reference-page/mobile-links)*  
The reengineered copy can be found here - *[Mobile Link v1](https://mheerspink75.github.io/MLv1/Mobile_Link_v1.html)* hosted on GitHub.

**3.** I then reworked the interface design to include more content pages, navigation menus, CSS grid and Google Custom Search optimized for web development search criteria. I have included a user input form to add functionality to the [About Page](https://mheerspink75.github.io/Pages/About.html). The GitHub Repository *["mheerspink75.github.io"](https://github.com/mheerspink75/mheerspink75.github.io)* is now hosting the updated version [Mobile Link v2](https://mheerspink75.github.io/MLv2/MobileLinkv2.html).

**4.** Created NavTool page for desktop to increase productivity when adding new page layouts to Mobile Link. NavTool serves as a development tool for quickly testing new page layout design and functionality.
